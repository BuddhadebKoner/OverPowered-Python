1. Tuples are used to store values of different data types. Lists can however, store data of similar data types. 

2. Since tuples are immutable, iterating through tuples is faster than iterating over a list. This means that a tuple performs better than a list.

3. Tuples can be used as key for a dictionary but lists cannot be used as keys. We will learn about dictionaries in the next section.

4. Tuples are best suited for storing data that is write-protected (you can read the data but cannot write to it).

5. Tuples can be used in place of lists where the number of values is known and small. tuple as an argument to a function, then the potential for unexpected behavior due to

6. If you are passing a aliasing gets reduced.

7. Multiple values from a function can be returned using a tuple.

8. Tuples are used to format strings.
