## Explanation of Code

#### Definition of Classes (Dog and Animal):

- `Dog` class has two static methods: `bark()` and `eat()`.
- `Animal` class inherits from `Dog` and has an `__init__` method to initialize the `name` attribute.

#### Object Creation:

- Two instances of the `Animal` class are created: `dog1` and `dog2`. During the instantiation, the `__init__` method of the `Animal` class is called for each instance, setting their `name` attributes.

#### Accessing Attributes:

- The `name` attribute of `dog1` and `dog2` are accessed using `print(dog1.name, dog2.name)`. This will print the names of the dogs (`Tomy` and `Mote`).

#### Accessing Methods:

- The `bark()` method is called on `dog1` using `print(dog1.bark())`. Since `bark()` is a static method, it doesn't require an instance of the class to be called. It will print `I can bark`.
- Similarly, the `eat()` method is called on `dog2` using `print(dog2.eat())`, which prints `I can eat`.

#### Visual Representation:

```plaintext
              Dog
          +-------------+
          |  bark()     |
          |  eat()      |
          +-------------+
                 |
                 |
                 V
              Animal
          +-------------+
          |  __init__() |
          +-------------+
          |  name       |
          +-------------+
 ```        
- The `Dog` class serves as the parent class.
- The `Animal` class is derived from the `Dog` class (child class).
- Instances of the `Animal` class `(dog1 and dog2)` inherit methods from the Dog class.
- Each instance of `Animal` has its own `name` attribute.
