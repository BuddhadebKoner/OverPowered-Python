# Python Learning Journey 27 April 2024

Welcome to my Python Learning Repository! This repository contains my journey through the basics of Python, including working with SQL and MongoDB, culminating in a basic To-Do application. It's designed as a reflection of the fundamental concepts I've learned while studying Python.

## Overview

This repository covers the essential Python concepts, progressing from basic syntax and control structures to interacting with databases. The main goal was to strengthen my understanding of Python and how it interacts with SQL and MongoDB databases by building a simple but functional To-Do application.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language for this project.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight SQL database for learning SQL integration.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for working with document-based storage.

## Projects

### 1. Basic Python Programs
This section includes small, fundamental Python scripts to practice the basics such as:
- Variables, data types, loops, conditionals
- Functions and error handling
- Working with files (reading/writing)

### 2. SQL Integration
Introduced SQLite to learn how to:
- Connect Python with SQL databases
- Perform basic SQL operations like `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` (CRUD)
- Understand the structure of relational databases

### 3. MongoDB Integration
Learned how to work with MongoDB in Python by using:
- Establishing connections to a MongoDB server
- Performing CRUD operations in a NoSQL database

### 4. Basic To-Do Application
A simple To-Do application that allows users to:
- Add, view, update, and delete tasks
- Demonstrates how Python works with both SQL and MongoDB
